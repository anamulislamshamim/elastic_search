🧠 About Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a powerful, distributed search and analytics engine designed for fast and scalable data retrieval. It stores data as JSON documents and allows flexible full-text, structured, and vector-based queries through its Query DSL.

In modern AI and backend applications, Elasticsearch is widely used for:

Full-text search – quickly finding documents based on keywords and relevance scoring.

Filtering and aggregations – efficiently handling structured queries, analytics, and metrics.

Semantic (vector) search – storing and comparing dense embeddings for natural language understanding and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.

Real-time performance – near-instant search results even on large datasets through distributed indexing.

It integrates easily with Python, Node.js, and other ecosystems, making it ideal for applications that require both text relevance and vector similarity — such as chatbots, recommendation engines, and knowledge retrieval systems.
